### UPDATING LIBDEMANGLE LIB LOCATION
* The location of libdemangle can be changed by updating all the Makefile that contains either these keywords
`libdemangle.a` and `ldemangle`
* Additionally, when one runs `configure`, the LDFLAGS should point to the directory that contains the library

### BUILD CFA DEMANGLER
* To get CFA demangler built, a copy of `libdemangle.a` should be included in the top level directory.
* Then run `./configure 'LDFLAGS=-L<path_of_libdemangle>' 'CC=gcc-6'`
